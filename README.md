[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c6ee03f6-3436-4269-9f96-2ee2318ac451/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/youthful-lewin-03cade/deploys)

This starter template has two main dependencies:
1. Eleventy
2. Ghost Content API

They can be installed by cloning this repository and running ```npm install```.

Once the dependencies are installed, you'll need to change the Ghost Content API details in ```/_data/ghost.js``` to match those of your own Ghost account.

To run a local build and watch for changes, use ```npx eleventy --serve```.

## Try it out!

Other than the Ghost integration, this starter template follows standard Eleventy conventions, to the best of my knowledge.
